# dOTF-analysis
This project focused on making a GUI app using matlab named "SWIFT-TEZ" for phase estimations and wavefront error visualization of PSFs(.fits files) using dOTF(differential optical transfer function) algorithm and further decomposing the phase into zernike coefficients. 

## Disclaimer
This app is in development phase and contains few limitations in its functionalities.
